#Deep tech Assignment

## Description
This project is a full-stack application built with **Next.js** for the frontend and **Express.js** for the backend. The application allows users to register, log in, manage their cart, and view products.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 
- MongoDB 
### Frontend Setup

1. Clone the frontend repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ibukun-tech/my-fullstack-app.git
   ```

   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the backend repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ibukun-tech/deeptech.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd Backend
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm run run:dev
   ```

5. The backend will run on `http://localhost:3030`.

## Features
- User authentication (login and registration)
- Cart management
- Product listing
- Responsive design

## Known Issues
Due to network limitations and time constraints, the following features were not fully implemented:
- **API Integration**: The login functionality is currently simulated. The actual API call to authenticate users was not completed due to network issues.
- **User Registration**: The user registration feature was planned but not implemented in time for the deadline.
- **Error Handling**: More robust error handling for API responses was intended but not fully realized.

## Future Improvements
- Implement the actual API for user authentication.
- Add user registration functionality.
- Enhance error handling and user feedback mechanisms.
- Improve UI/UX based on user testing and feedback.

**Note:** It seems I mistakenly initialized a Git repository for the frontend.
